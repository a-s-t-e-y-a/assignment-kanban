## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: v18 or higher
- **pnpm**: v8 or higher (Install: `npm install -g pnpm`)
- **MongoDB**: Atlas account or local MongoDB instance

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/a-s-t-e-y-a/assignment-kanban.git
cd assignment-kanban
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
First, install root dependencies (including concurrently):
```bash
pnpm install
```

Then install client & server dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install:all
```

Or run the complete setup command:
```bash
pnpm setup
```

Or install separately:
```bash
pnpm install:client
pnpm install:server
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

#### Client (.env in `client/` directory)
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD_BACKEND_URL=https://assignment-kanban-production.up.railway.app/
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV=true
```

#### Server (.env in `server/` directory)
```env
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/kanban
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
CLIENT_DEV_URL=http://localhost:3000
CLIENT_PROD_URL=https://assignment-kanban-eosin.vercel.app/
DEV=true
```

---

## Running the Application

### Development Mode (Recommended)

**Run both client and server together:**
```bash
pnpm dev
```

This starts:
- Backend: `http://localhost:5000`
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`

**Run individually:**
```bash
pnpm dev:client    # Frontend only
pnpm dev:server    # Backend only
```

### Production Mode

**Build the client:**
```bash
pnpm build
```

**Run in production:**
```bash
pnpm start
```

### Other Commands

**Clean all dependencies and builds:**
```bash
pnpm clean
```

## Current Limitations & Assumptions

### 1. Member Invitation System
**Current Implementation**: To add a new member to a project, the user must first create a new account via the signup page.

**Reason**: Due to time constraints, a full email invitation system with token-based authentication has not been implemented.

**Planned Solution**: Implement an invite system where:
- Project owners can send email invites with unique tokens
- Recipients receive emails with invitation links
- Users can accept invitations without existing accounts
- Token-based verification for secure onboarding

### 2. Real-time Communication Metadata
**Current Implementation**: WebSocket events only broadcast that an action occurred (task created/updated/deleted) without detailed metadata.

**Limitation**: The notification doesn't show:
- Which user performed the action
- Timestamp of the action
- Specific changes made (diff)

**Reason**: Simplified implementation due to time constraints.

**Planned Solution**: Include metadata in socket events:
```javascript
{
  action: 'task_updated',
  user: { name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' },
  timestamp: '2025-10-29T10:30:00Z',
  changes: { title: 'Old Title' â†’ 'New Title' }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Responsive Design
**Implemented**: The UI is fully responsive and works seamlessly across:
- Mobile devices (320px+)
- Tablets (768px+)
- Desktops (1024px+)

### Current Performance Limitations

#### 1. **No Server-Side Caching**
- Every API request hits the database directly
- No Redis or in-memory cache implemented
- Can cause slower response times under load

#### 2. **No Rate Limiting**
- API endpoints are not rate-limited
- Vulnerable to abuse and DDoS attacks
- Could impact server performance

#### 3. **Database Query Optimization**
- Basic Mongoose queries without aggregation pipelines
- No indexing strategy documented
- Could be optimized for large datasets


### Solutions with Redis

**Redis could be implemented for**:
1. **Session Caching**: Store user sessions instead of database lookups
2. **API Response Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data (projects, tasks)
3. **Rate Limiting**: Track request counts per user/IP
4. **Job Queues**: Handle background tasks (email notifications, etc.)
5. **Real-time Pub/Sub**: Scale WebSocket across multiple server instances

---

## Future Scope


1. **Email OTP Verification** - Verify user email during signup
2. **Forgot Password** - Password reset via email
3. **Email-based Member Invitations** - Send invite links to new members
4. **Rate Limiting** - Implement Redis-based rate limiting
5. **Server-Side Caching** - Redis caching for API responses


## Known Issues

1. **Postman Collection**: Outdated - some endpoints may not match current API
2. **Concurrent Edits**: Last write wins (no optimistic locking)
3. **Toast Positioning**: May overlap in rare cases with multiple notifications
4. **WebSocket Reconnection**: May require page refresh in some network conditions
